The goal for the day is to make a simple game at the end of the day,
The game is called wordle, i used to play it alot while i was free during my college days.
What will i potentially learn from the project?
1)Logic building for a Game
2)DOM manipulation in action
3)The pure experience of using javascript
4)Will try to implement something from Canvas API at the end
5)Will try to be creative and implement my own parts to it maybe.
Let's Dive IN.....



What new stuff have, i seen as of now:

1. hsl();
2. custom attributes
3. why EM font size is powerful
4. user-select: none;
5. fill, used for SVG icons coloring
6. clamp(a,b,c) - font size styling, a is the smallest value(in px), b is default(in vh,vw,vmin,vmax), c is the    largest(in px);
